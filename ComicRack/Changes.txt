Community Edition Build 0.9.180:

* NEW: RAR5 Support (Default & SharpCompress)
* NEW: Added the Git version to the Splash Screen, to more easily identify bugs in specific releases.
* NEW: Added the "-local" command line switch, to have the program load on portable mode.
* NEW: Added links to The Organizer guide to the online manual help system
* NEW: Added the possibility for unknown elements that may have been added my other software to the ComicInfo.xml to be kept.
* NEW: Added possibility to add articles that terminate with an apostrophe in IgnoredArticles.
* NEW: Added French articles (Le, La, Les, L') as default in IgnoredArticles.

* CHANGE: Updated to .NET Framework v4.8
* CHANGE: Updated the Splash Screen and Renamed the Program to Community Edition, this means that a new config folder will be used %appdata%\cYo\ComicRack Community Edition. 
* CHANGE: Removed Android Validation of apk signature (so we can use the cracked version). Has no incidence on whether the sync icon appears.
* CHANGE: Updated default sort to be natural sorting (numeric)
* CHANGE: Switched MySQl library to MySQLConnector for better speed & compatibility with MariaDB
* CHANGE: Alternate config (-ac) can now be used with portable mode (UseLocalSettings) (-local)

* CHANGE: The default docking mode is now Fill, instead of Bottom
* CHANGE: Improved performances while handling Tar files (by Apiweb)
* CHANGE: Removed the Crash submission dialog because it depends on the cyolito.com website
* CHANGE: Disabled the Public server checkbox because it depends on the cyolito.com website
* CHANGE: Made Tags be saved inside the ComicInfo.xml. First Sync after the update will cause all the data to be updated, so a slower sync is expected. (will this mess with other programs that uses the ComicInfo.xml?)
* CHANGE: Changed ParallelConversions from 8 to the Number of Processor. ini says it was related to the number of Processor, but I do not see any evidence for that setting. This only increases the number of pages it converts at the same time. 
* CHANGE: Replaced the old news by the Community Edition commit history.
 
* BUGFIX: (Maybe?) Fixed crash when the clipboard contains some objects while the program is idle. The check should now only happen on a right-click and not in the background. It should at least lessen the frequency of the crash, maybe remove it completely. 
* BUGFIX: Fixed smartlist "in range" for dates, the second field wasn't taken into account.
* BUGFIX: Fixed possible crash if window size is less than 0 (Usually when using high DPI scaling).
* BUGFIX: Fixed a bug where clicking a folder that didn't exists anymore, would show the files from the program installation directory.
* BUGFIX: Fixed missing entry (MainCharacterOrTeam, Review & CommunityRating) in ComicInfo.xml.
